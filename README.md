Question Answering Task Classifier will help to give us an idea of the probable answer type, if we give it an context and the corresponding question related to the context. So it will tell us firstly whether answering the question is possible or not, and if possible whether it is a yes or no type answer, extractive or abstractive answer.

We got 90.07% test accuracy over the entire test sample,
